# Virtual Analog

Note:
  - Installed tensorflow GPU version "pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.1.2". If you don't have a GPU, just install normal tensorflow, but preferably a version compatible with this one as I don't really want to install tensorflow-gpu with different version... I would then have to reinstall CUDA and lots of potential compatibility issues... ;)
